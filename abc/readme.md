- **Simple**: Linear sequences, 2-5 tasks, minimal branching
- **Medium**: Some conditional logic, 5-15 tasks, moderate complexity
- **Complex**: Requires human approval before creation

**Translation Pipeline**:
```
Natural Language → Intent Analysis → Task Extraction → 
Dependency Mapping → Template Matching → Workflow Generation → 
Human Validation → Executable Workflow
```

**Key Features**:
- Intent recognition with 85%+ accuracy for business processes
- Automatic task type classification (6 core types)
- Dependency analysis and optimization
- Criticality assessment for human oversight points

### 2. Workflow Definition Schema

**Core Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface WorkflowDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  tasks: WorkflowTask[];           // Individual workflow steps
  dependencies: TaskDependency[];  // Task execution order
  executionMode: ExecutionMode;    // SUPERVISED | MONITORED | AUTONOMOUS
  approvalPoints: ApprovalPoint[]; // Human oversight requirements
  requiredAgentTypes: AgentTypeRequirement[];
  stateSchema: WorkflowStateSchema; // State management integration
}
```

**Task Types Supported**:
- `DATA_PROCESSING`: File processing, data transformation
- `COMMUNICATION`: Email, notifications, messaging
- `ANALYSIS`: Data analysis, report generation
- `VALIDATION`: Quality checks, compliance verification
- `DECISION`: Conditional logic, routing decisions
- `INTEGRATION`: External system interactions

### 3. Template System

**Built-in Templates**:
1. **Customer Onboarding** - Identity verification, account setup, welcome communications
2. **Data Processing Pipeline** - ETL workflows with validation
3. **Approval Workflow** - Multi-stage approval processes
4. **Notification System** - Event-driven communication workflows

**Template Features**:
- Parameterized task definitions

**Key Capabilities**:
- Agent pool management and selection
- Task scheduling and coordination
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Error detection and recovery
- State-based agent communication

### 5. State Management Integration

**Workspace Pattern Extension**:
```typescript
// Leverages existing State Management Service patterns
Workspace → Play → Task States → Coordination Primitives
```

**State Operations**:
- Task state tracking and updates
- Shared data management
- Communication channel coordination
- Checkpoint and synchronization management

### 6. Agent Coordination

**Agent Pool Strategy**:
- Work with pre-existing agent pools
- Agent selection based on capabilities and performance
- Load balancing and availability management
- Performance tracking and optimization

**Coordination Mechanisms**:
- State-based communication (no direct agent-to-agent messaging)
- Task dependency resolution
- Parallel execution coordination
- Error propagation and recovery

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery

**Error Classification**:
- `TASK_FAILURE`: Individual task execution errors
- `AGENT_UNAVAILABLE`: Agent pool exhaustion
- `TIMEOUT`: Task or workflow timeouts
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Data or process validation failures
- `DEPENDENCY_FAILURE`: Upstream task failures

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Agent replacement and task reassignment
- Human escalation for critical failures
- Workflow pause and manual intervention
- Partial rollback and state recovery

### 8. Human Oversight Integration

**Approval Points**:
- Critical task execution decisions
- High-risk data operations
- External system integrations
- Workflow modifications during execution

**Oversight Mechanisms**:
- Real-time approval queues
- Risk-based escalation rules
- Performance monitoring dashboards
- Audit trails and compliance reporting
